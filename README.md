# Welcome to WHOLISTIC-registration
**A fast, accurate, and non-rigid image registration method for Whole-Body cellular activity Imaging.**

## Introduction
WBI Registration is a cutting-edge method designed to correct non-rigid motion caused by skeletal and smooth muscle contractions. This enables precise cellular activity analysis and motion analysis for fluorescent data. The method utilizes patch-wise iterative modified optical flow with an image pyramid to achieve high flexibility and robustness.


Below are examples showcasing the results of WBI Registration:

## Advantage:
- **Accurate non-rigid registration**: Delivers precise motion correction.
- **Fast and parallelizable**: Optimized for GPU acceleration.
- **Flexible masking**: Allows users to ignore unwanted regions.
- **Robust to noise**: Performs well even with noisy fluorescent data.

## Suitable Data for WBI Registration
WBI Registration assumes that the template image and the moving image have similar intensities (or change gradually). Thus, At least one channel of your data should avoid fast-changing activities, such as Calcium activity signals, to ensure optimal results.

## Using the Code
See [```demo.m```](https://github.com/Weizheng96/WholeFishAnalyss/blob/main/demo.m) for a demonstration of how to use the code. The algorithm is implemented in the function ```getMotionHZR_Wei_v2d2.m```. GPU acceleration is recommended for optimal performance.

| Parameter name | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ```dat_ref``` | Template image. |
| ```dat_mov``` | Moving image. |
| ```smoothPenalty``` | Smoothness penalty for the motion field. Higher values produce smoother motion fields. |
| ```option.layer``` | Number of downsampled pyramid layers. More layers help avoid local optima. |
| ```option.iter``` | Maximum number of iterations per layer. |
| ```option.r``` | 	Patch size control. Larger patch sizes yield more rigid but reliable results. |
| ```option.mask_ref``` | Mask for the template image. Pixels set to ```true``` are ignored during registration. |
| ```option.mask_mov``` | Mask for the moving image. Pixels set to ```true``` are ignored during registration. |
